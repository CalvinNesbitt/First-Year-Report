\section{Linear Response Theory in Simple Chaotic Models} \label{section: LRT}

The chief aim of our PhD work is the implementation of the Ruelle response formula \cite{Ruelle2009} to the MAOOAM quasi-geostrophic atmosphere ocean model \cite{DeCruz2016}. Here we will discuss briefly the idea of this formula and mention how we have started work explicitly in this direction by attempting to implement the so called `s3 algorithm' \cite{Chandramoorthy2020}.
