\begin{abstract}
\noindent We present a summary of the work carried out during the first year of study towards the PhD in the Mathematics of Planet Earth. Our work has centred on two directions, namely Lyapunov analysis and linear response. We present the basic theory of both as well as our attempts to implement aspects of each in numerical models of relevance to multiscale geophysical fluid dynamics.
