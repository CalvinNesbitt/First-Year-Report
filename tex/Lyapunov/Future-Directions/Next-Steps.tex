\subsection{Future Directions} \label{subsection: Lyapunov future}

There are three directions in which we aim to build upon this work.\\

The first has already begun, and will be explained further in section \ref{section: LRT}: the use of CLVs in linear response theory.\\

A second is inspired by the recent work of Galfi \cite{Galfi2019} which investigates spatiotemporal large deviations.\\

The final is more speculative and that is the connection with UPOs.
