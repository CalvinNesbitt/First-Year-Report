\section{Introduction}

Our work this year has largely centred on two directions. The first is the study of Lyapunov exponents and their fluctuations from the point of view of large deviation theory. The second is linear response theory for differentiable dynamical systems. The former has been the earlier focus, whilst in many ways the second builds on the first.\\

The first part of our PhD work has centred on implementing an algorithm of Ginelli \cite{Ginelli2013} to calculate the Lyapunov exponents and vectors for two simple models: Lorenz 63 (L63) and Lorenz 96 (L96). The implementation in Lorenz 63 was largely a test case whilst in Lorenz 96 we have been able to find an expected correspondence between finite time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) and the timescale of the dynamics. This work has been built on by also looking at the fluctuations of the FTLEs in the hope of finding a large deviation result. In section \ref{section: Lyap-Analysis} we will present some of the basic ideas underlying this work and a summary of our findings over the past year. In the final part of this section we also discuss our future aims in this direction.
