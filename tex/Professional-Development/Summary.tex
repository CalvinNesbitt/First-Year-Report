\section{Professional Development}

Over the past year we have taken part in a variety of activities for our professional development which we briefly mention here. We regularly attend seminars organised by the MPE as well as those in the University of Reading Meteorology department. We have been involved in and presented at a semester long reading group on advanced topics in geophysical fluid dynamics organised by Arnaud Czaja at Imperial College London. We have attended conferences, both online and in person, notably EGU 2020 and the IHP trimester on the Mathematics of Climate and the Environment. We have been in contact with and begun the process of collaborating with other researchers in the field, namely Chiara Maiocchi - a fellow MPE student, Melinda Galfi at the University of Hamburg and Nisha Chandramoorthy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These collaborations are only just beginning and area we hope to devote more time to in the coming year. We have also completed a RRDP graduate school course on writing up data analysis. We had hoped to attend further courses on writing literature reviews and data management but were not able to do so following the Covid 19 outbreak. Finally we can confirm that we have completed the required learning needs analysis.
